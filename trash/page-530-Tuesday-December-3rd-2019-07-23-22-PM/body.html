<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As Mustard and Prince and Figger made successive trips through the crowd of negroes, coming back each time with a little silver, Skeeter Butts noted with uneasiness the absence of certain cheap watches, brassy finger-rings, and gaudy, sparkling scarf-pins.</p><p>Finally Figger Bush placed a fifty-cent piece against Sugar’s choice and sighed:</p><p>“Ef dat Doodle wins Gawd knows whut <em>dis</em> dude’ll do! I’s done bet de barlow-knife outen my pocket  an’ borried money on dese very clothes I wears. I’s plum busted, popped open, cleant out!”</p><p>Three horses loped up toward the starting pole.</p><p>Skeeter observed with satisfaction that Doodle-Bug balked right in front of the grand stand, that half a dozen men tried to make him move and failed, that the little jockey was bucked off, and that Doodle-Bug finally turned a complete somersault, landing on his back.</p></div> </div>
