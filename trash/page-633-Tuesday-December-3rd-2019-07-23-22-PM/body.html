Each member was trying to think out what Hitch meant. After a while Skeeter Butts remarked:</p><p>“I favors buyin’ a D.D. fer Vinegar, an’ I now cont’ibutes one dollars to dat puppus.”</p><p>Skeeter walked over to the altar in the middle of the lodge floor and dropped a resounding dollar upon the top. The negroes looked at the dollar with great curiosity, but they needed more light before they were willing to add any money to that contribution. After another silence, Figger Bush asked:</p><p>“Whut is dat one silver dollar fer, Skeeter?”</p><p>“To he’p buy a D.D.,” Skeeter informed him.</p><p>“Whut am a D.D.?” Bush inquired.</p><p>“It’s a—a—a kawlidge piece of paper wid writin’ on it,” Skeeter explained lamely.</p><p>“How much do she cost?” Bush persisted.</p></div> </div>
