Then he asked:</p><p>“Now that you’ve got her, Lem, what are you going to do with her?”</p><p>“I’m going to give her to you!” Lem said quietly.</p><p>“Wha-what?” Gaitskill barked, springing to his feet again. “Good gosh!”</p><p>“I’ll have to do that, Tom,” Manse said defensively. “This is the first time she has been on land since I bought her. Now, I’d like to leave her here with you all the time, but if you won’t keep her——”</p><p>“I won’t,” Gaitskill snapped. “You can bet on it, I won’t!”</p><p>“Well, keep her here for me for two weeks,” Manse pleaded. “I’ve got to run up to St. Louis on some business, and when I come back, I’ll take her away with me.”</p></div> </div>
