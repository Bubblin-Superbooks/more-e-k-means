He was the only idler in Tickfall, a compulsory idler, for the reform had put him out of business. The sound of the fiddle and the banjo was heard no more. Laughter and shouting had ceased. Not a negro entered his barroom, and most of his regular customers passed on the other side of the street. Skeeter sat in front of his saloon all day in mournful and fearful loneliness.</p><p>Then, just at dark, he had the surprise of his life.</p><p>Three men came up the street and stopped, talked for a moment in low tones, then entered the saloon on tiptoe and came to where Skeeter was sitting behind the bar.</p><p>“Us is a cormittee to wait on you, Skeeter,” Vinegar Atts said in funereal tones.</p><p>“Whut is I done?” Skeeter asked in a frightened voice.</p></div> </div>
