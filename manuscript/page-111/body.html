<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Gaitskill slowly drew in the rope and was busy making another noose, when there was a warning shout from the negroes.</p><p>Diada was coming across the clearing toward Gaitskill, leaping like a deer. There was no trace of anger in her manner, and no sign of danger except the long-bladed knife in her powerful hand.</p><p>Gaitskill’s nervous horse shied at that monstrous  woman with her fluttering, ragged garments, and wheeled and bolted, snorting with terror.</p><p>The jungle kept the horse in the clearing as effectively as a barbed-wire fence, but the animal had two acres of level ground to run on and he proceeded to cover that ground in record-breaking time. Gaitskill might have quieted the animal very quickly, except for the fact that this performance seemed to please Diada, and she continued her pursuit, chasing Colonel Gaitskill all around the lot.</p></div> </div>
