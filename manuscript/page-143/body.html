The watching men saw her lift her hands high toward the heavens. Then they heard a long, clear shout, ending with the familiar: “Whoosh! Whoo-ash!”</p><p>The yacht answered with two short, sharp whistle signals.</p><p>Diada ran swiftly down the levee, and then leaped high and plunged far over into the muddy waters of the Mississippi!</p><p>The wondering, watching men saw her head emerge from the waves, saw her swim like a fish to the yacht, saw her seize a rope which was tossed over the side, and climb hand over hand to safety and rest and peace and the care and protection of her friends!</p><p>“That’s all, men!” Gaitskill said in a voice which choked in his throat. “You may all go back home now.
