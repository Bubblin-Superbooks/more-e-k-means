<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Diada came out of an alley beside the Gaitskill store and stood in the middle of the street. She was holding Dr. Sentelle’s ponderous walking stick by the small end like a club. She gazed, apparently in wonder, at the crowd of negroes and whites.</p><p>As the silent mob viewed her with alarm, wondering what outrage she would commit next, she caught the big stick with a hand on either end, raised it high above her head, and screamed:</p><p>“Whoosh! Whoo-ash! Whoosh!”</p><p>Flournoy drew his pistol and fired in the air above her head three times.</p><p>Diada ducked at each shot, then she stood upright, whirled the club around her head, and threw it at the sheriff. The missile curved like an arrow and went straight toward the mark. Flournoy  avoided a crushed skull by falling flat upon the ground and letting the club pass over him.</p></div> </div>
