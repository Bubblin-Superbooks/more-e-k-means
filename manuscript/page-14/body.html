<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When these tales were first published in the <em>All Story Weekly</em>, many readers declared that they were humorous. Nevertheless, I hold that a story containing dialect must necessarily have many depressing and melancholy features. But dialect does not consist of perverted pronunciations and phonetic orthography. True dialect is a picture in cold type of the manifold peculiarities of the mind and temperament. In its form, I have attempted to give merely a <em>flavor</em> of the negro dialect; but I have made a sincere attempt to preserve the essence of dialect by making these stories contain a true idea of the negroâ€™s shrewd observations, curious retorts, quaint comments, humorous philosophy, and his unique point of view on everything that comes to his attention.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The Folk Tales of Joel Chandler Harris are imperishable pictures of plantation life in the South before the Civil War and of the negro slave who echoed</p></div> </div>
