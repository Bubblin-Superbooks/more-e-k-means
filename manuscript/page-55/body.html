They had heard much about Diada since her arrival in Tickfall and they were awed to an electric silence of waiting, holding themselves in smiling readiness for the entrance of the stranger from the cannibal islands of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>The minutes passed.

I ain’t pesterin’ my mind ’bout her. Dat nigger ain’t my kind of black folks!”</p><p>“Go find Diada at once! Bring her into the drawing-room! Hear me!”</p><p>“Yes’m, I’ll fotch her in!”</p></div> </div>
