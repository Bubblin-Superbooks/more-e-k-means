He turned to the tall, weather-tanned man who sat beside him on the porch and spoke:</p><p>“Lem, I have known you and loved you for thirty years. I have applauded most of the things you have done. But it is now my solemn duty to inform you that you are a d—— fool!”</p><p>Captain Lemuel Manse broke into a loud laugh. He looked at Diada and laughed again; then he looked at Gaitskill’s horrified countenance and laughed louder.</p><p>“I’m afraid you have none of the spirit of the Christian missionary, Tom,” Manse finally managed to say.</p></div> </div>
