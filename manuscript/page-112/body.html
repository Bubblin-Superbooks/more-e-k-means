Come on, men!”</p><p>The path widened and the horses struck into a trot which brought them to the hog-camp in half an hour.</p><p>Throughout the length and breadth of this swamp, about a mile apart, there were curious mounds rising ten or twelve feet above the surrounding marsh. All these mounds were round in shape and flat on the top.</p><p>Some of them were not more than a hundred feet in diameter, while others were large, containing half an acre of land. They had been built a hundred years before by the Indians—and served a very practical purpose. When the water flooded the swamp in the autumn the wild animals took refuge on these mounds. The Indians penetrated the jungle in their canoes and visited each mound, easily  slaying the deer and bears, and thus procuring their winter supply of meat.</p></div> </div>
