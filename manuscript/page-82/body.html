Like a child chewing a thread, she began at one end and lapped up link after link of the sausage. When that  had been devoured, she snatched down another string and began on the end of that. Then she snapped off a link and offered it to Vinegar Atts.</p><p>“No’m; thank ’e, mum,” Vinegar said. “I likes to watch you chawin’ it. Fer Gawd’s sake, don’t nibble at dat sausage like dat—<em>eat a plenty</em>!”</p><p>Hitch Diamond pulled down two more strings of the sausage and handed them to her.</p><p>“Honey,” he said in wheedling tones, “don’t encourage no delicate appetite. Fill up—fill up! Wallop up dem sassages till you git whar you cain’t do nothin’ but chaw because yo’ swaller is full up to de top. Den, bless Gawd, dar won’t be no room in yo’ insides fer me!”</p></div> </div>
