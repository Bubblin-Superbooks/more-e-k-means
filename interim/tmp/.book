Kemble.</h5>",
  "page-12": "<h3>Foreword.</h3><p class=\"  start-chapter\">The stories in this volume were written simply because of my interest in the stories themselves and because of a whimsical fondness for the people of that Race to whom God has given two supreme gifts,—Music and Laughter.</p><p>For the benefit of the curious, I may say that many of the incidents in these tales are true and many of the characters and places mentioned actually exist.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Hen-Scratch saloon derived its name from the fact that many of its colored habitués played “craps” on the ground under the chinaberry trees until the soil was</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">marked by their scratching finger-nails like a chicken-yard. The name Tickfall is fictitious, but the locality will be easily recognized by the true names of the negro settlements, Dirty-Six, Hell’s-Half-Acre, Shiny, Tin-row,—lying in the sand around that rich and aristocratic little town like pigs around their dam and drawing their sustenance therefrom.</p><p>Skeeter Butts’s real name is Perique. Perique is also the name of Louisiana’s famous homegrown tobacco, and as Skeeter is too diminutive to be named after a whole cigar, his white friends iv have always called him Butts. Vinegar Atts is a well-known colored preacher of north Louisiana, whose “swing-tail prancin’-albert coat” has been seen in many pulpits, and whose “stove-pipe, preachin’ hat” has been the target of many a stone thrown from a mischievous white boy’s hand. Hitch Diamond is known at every landing place on the Mississippi River as “Big Sandy.”</p>",
  "page-14": "<p>When these tales were first published in the <em>All Story Weekly</em>, many readers declared that they were humorous. Nevertheless, I hold that a story containing dialect must necessarily have many depressing and melancholy features. But dialect does not consist of perverted pronunciations and phonetic orthography. True dialect is a picture in cold type of the manifold peculiarities of the mind and temperament. In its form, I have attempted to give merely a <em>flavor</em> of the negro dialect; but I have made a sincere attempt to preserve the essence of dialect by making these stories contain a true idea of the negro’s shrewd observations, curious retorts, quaint comments, humorous philosophy, and his unique point of view on everything that comes to his attention.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Folk Tales of Joel Chandler Harris are imperishable pictures of plantation life in the South before the Civil War and of the negro slave who echoed</p>",
  "page-15": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">all his master’s prejudice of caste and pride of family in the old times that are no more.</p><p>The negroes of this volume are the sons of the old slaves. Millions of them live to-day in the small Southern villages, and as these stories indicate, v many changes of character, mind, and temperament have taken place in the last half-century through the modifications of freedom and education.</p><p>This type also is passing. In a brief time, the negro who lives in these pages will be a memory, like Uncle Remus. “Ethiopia is stretching out her hands” after art, science, literature, and wealth, and when the sable sons of laughter and song grasp these treasures, all that remains of the Southern village negro of to-day will be a few faint sketches in Fiction’s beautiful temple of dreams.</p><p>E.

But I hope that dear heathen won’t perform any circus stunts.”</p><p>The conversation was brought to a close by the arrival of the Reverend Dr. Sentelle, an aged, feeble, badly crippled man, who leaned heavily upon his walking stick as he entered the door.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">That walking stick was a curiosity.

I was wounded in that battle, sir, and as you can observe, have been a cripple ever since. I fell beneath a dogwood tree and lay there for nearly two days. After the surrender, sir, I returned to the battlefield and cut down that tree and have carried it ever since as a walking stick. The tree was fertilized by my blood, sir, and it is only just that it should bear my infirmities.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">While imparting this information, it was the invariable custom of the venerable preacher to catch his stick by the little end and emphasize his remarks by waving it above his auditor’s head. And as he could not stand for any length of time without his cane, it was a common thing to see him during his pulpit discourses reverse his stick and shake it at the heads of his congregation, exactly as many an irate baseball player has punctuated his remarks to the fans in the grand</p>",

They stiffened in their seats. They had heard much about Diada since her arrival in Tickfall and they were awed to an electric silence of waiting, holding themselves in smiling readiness for the entrance of the stranger from the cannibal islands of the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>The minutes passed. The silence became oppressive. Colonel Gaitskill jiggled his feet. Then through the open window came the voice of Mrs. Gaitskill:</p><p>“Hopey, have you seen Diada?”</p><p>“No’m. I ain’t saw her. I ain’t pesterin’ my mind ’bout her. Dat nigger ain’t my kind of black folks!”</p><p>“Go find Diada at once! Bring her into the drawing-room! Hear me!”</p><p>“Yes’m, I’ll fotch her in!”</p>",
  "page-56": "<p>Twenty minutes later Mrs. Gaitskill entered the drawing-room alone. The situation was embarrassing, but Mrs. Gaitskill was not even slightly flustered. She possessed an immense reserve of coolness which contrasted sharply on this occasion with the painful distraction of her husband.</p><p>The minutes passed—leaden minutes. Some of the guests made a pretense of little conversational flurries.</p><p>“Our missionaries are so heroic—The lecture was so edifying—How they must love their work—I have often felt a call—Their lives are very lonely—Sacrifice and service—My daughter shows such a fine missionary spirit—I tell Eula—The lovely cannibals—I always say—Of course——”</p><p>These hushed, tentative fragments of conversation were interrupted by the triumphant, booming voice of Hopey:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Hey, dar—you deef ’n’ dum’ nigger!

He came back to face the same intense, expectant silence which some of the guests attempted to relieve by exchanging seats with other guests. Once more there were scattering efforts at normal talk:</p><p>“The Christmas ship to the Belgians—Splendid missionary spirit—I haven’t much to give—I told her God loves the dear cannibals—Home and foreign—All the chickens I took from under the setting hen——”</p><p>“Git on up dem front steps!” Hopey howled, as if she were driving a pig. “Go on in dat front do’! Hurry!”</p><p>The front door opened and Diada entered, advanced to the center of the drawing-room, and stopped.</p>",
  "page-58": "<p>It is impossible to describe the peculiar sound which was emitted from the throats of the twenty women at their first sight of Diada.</p><p>Her physical ugliness was deplorable and appalling; but that which produced the peculiar utterance from the missionary ladies was this:</p><p>Diada was clothed in Mrs. Gaitskill’s light-blue,  pink-flowered kimono, and beneath that she wore Colonel Gaitskill’s sky-muckle-dun-colored pajamas!</p><p>Diada was six feet tall, and the kimono ended just below her knee and flared wide open in front, for two garments of the same size could not have enveloped her. The pajamas ended just above Diada’s black shoes and revealed about four inches of her stocking—the shoes and stockings being all that she now wore of the garments with which Mrs. Gaitskill had originally clothed her for the reception.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Diada stared about her for a moment, then sat down</p>",
  "page-59": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">upon the piano seat.</p><p>Her ponderous elbow struck the keys with a crashing discord, and Diada gave forth a sound expressive of delight—it sounded like the snort of an elephant. Then using her elbows instead of her hands, the dear immortal heathen proceeded to make the most unheavenly noise that ever vexed the ears of Christian missionaries, home or foreign.</p><p>In the midst of this horrifying situation, Hopey entered the drawing-room, her hands resting upon her hips, her mouth bawling voluble apologies:</p><p>“My Gawd, Mis’ Mildred!

  "page-61": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">house. Do it now! I’ll——”</p><p>Diada turned around and looked at Colonel Gaitskill. She beheld an immense club flourished threateningly above her head. On the day before, she had seen old Isaiah at the hog-camp waving an ax at her with the same menacing gesture.</p><p>With a loud whoop, Diada sprang across the drawing-room, dived headfirst through a large plateglass window, ran across the yard, and departed from Colonel Tom Gaitskill’s hospitable home forever.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

Maybe she’ll come back after a while.”</p><p>“You know she will not, Tom,” Mrs. Gaitskill protested with glistening eyes. “If she is not captured before she gets too deep in that swamp, she is gone forever.”</p><p>“If she took my pajamas with her, I’m fully resigned to the will of the Lord,” Gaitskill grinned. “They’re gone forever, too.”</p>",

Needless to say, he did not mention her ugliness, her size, her love for raw meat, nor his own overwhelming fear of her.</p>",
  "page-69": "<p>“Whut’s de matter wid dis swamp, Hitch?” Vinegar demanded, gazing at the trees and wiping the copious sweat from his face.</p><p>The swamp had suddenly become as hot as an anteroom to hell. The trees had lost their green sparkle, assuming the colors of decay—corpseyellow  and livid green, shining with an oily, sickening glitter.</p><p>Hitch shuddered.

Every tree and shrub leaned away from that icy blast, and vines which trailed the ground for hundreds of feet slowly rose up and whirled and writhed in the air like long, slim snakes.

  "page-108": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and thus procuring their winter supply of meat.</p><p>The Gaitskill hog-camp occupied the largest of these mounds, the cabin standing in the center of a two-acre plot.

All of Isaiah’s smoked sausage and hams had disappeared.

But Diada moved slowly backward, keeping in the cleared space, always just one leap distant from the jungle.</p><p>Twice they circled the clearing in this ridiculous fashion, Gaitskill repeating in most wheedling and coaxing tones every expression of fondness and endearment with which he was acquainted.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Dat chin-music ain’t gittin’ Marse Tom <em>nothin’</em>,” Vinegar Atts declared, watching the elusive Diada. “Me</p>",

There was not a trace of fear in her face, and she moved slowly backward until the rope was taut. To the interested negroes it looked like the simple, peaceable game of “playing horse.”</p><p>Then Gaitskill spurred his horse to one side and gave the rope a sharp jerk. Instantly a long-bladed butcher-knife flashed in Diada’s hand, and the severed rope trailed loosely upon the ground, while the now harmless noose slipped down over her hands and was lightly tossed aside.</p><p>“Dar now!” Hitch Diamond exclaimed in tragic tones. “Dat fish is done unbit an’ div!”</p>",

One word came from her throat with the explosive sound of a pistol-shot:</p><p>“_Whoo-ash!_”</p><p>There was no stopping his horse, so Gaitskill rode the four miles back to Tickfall in something like eight minutes.

While in the negro section closest to his home, Colonel Gaitskill could hear the Rev. Vinegar Atts bellowing like a bull of Bashan, praying in a voice which  could be heard a mile, while those who knelt with him backed him up in his stentorian implorations with responses which echoed like a roll of thunder:</p><p>“O Lawd, dese here is turr’ble times——”</p><p>(“Listen, Lawd, dat’s de trufe—turr’ble times——”)</p><p>“De sun is done turned inter darkness an’ de moon inter blood, an’ de drefful day of de Lawd am come——”</p><p>(“O-o-o Lawd, she sho’ am come——”)</p>",

Hundreds of negroes who had ridden in from the plantations the night before galloped down the road behind the whites. And every canine of any size or color attached himself to the posse and went plunging along with the men.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">They came to a straight stretch of road where they</p>",
  "page-130": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">could see for over two miles. At the far end of that stretch they beheld Diada, her head and shoulders stooped far over, trotting with gigantic strides, traveling with the tireless persistence of a desert camel.</p><p>To their surprise, Diada did not run into the swamp, but continued upon the main road, which led to the Tickfall landing on the Mississippi River. Seeing this, the men did not attempt to run her down, but remained content to keep her in sight. At the end of an hour she was still trotting easily with no signs of fatigue.</p><p>Finally Diada turned and ran into the forest. With a mighty clamor the men raced after her, floundering through the underbrush, and galloping far over into the woods. When the posse had passed out of sight among the trees, Diada quietly climbed down from the branches of a big tree, where she had concealed herself, and started down the road again.</p><p>The dogs discovered her first.</p>",
  "page-131": "<p>Yelping furiously they drove her from the main road across the prairie marsh which skirted Lake Basteneau, and penned her upon a narrow point which projected like a peninsula into the lake and was thickly overgrown with cypress saplings about as large around as a man’s wrist.</p><p>The marsh between the road and the lake was too soft for the men to venture on with their horses, and it was even dangerous for a man to walk upon because of the quicksands. But the men could look from the road, across a part of the lake, and easily see Diada and the dogs.</p><p>“Don’t go after her, men!” Flournoy called. “Let the dogs run her away from there! We’ll get her when she comes off that point!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">With the large butcher-knife which she had procured from Mrs. Gaitskill’s kitchen she had begun to cut down the cypress-saplings, trimming off the</p>",
  "page-132": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">leaves and the branches. She piled them up, dozens of them, working swiftly.</p><p>The dogs did not advance to attack Diada. They merely stood and barked at her. But they were in possession of the only exit from the narrow point on which Diada had been trapped.</p><p>“Dat gal must be gittin’ ready to beat dem dogs off wid dem poles,” Hitch Diamond remarked to the other negroes. “She’s shore put a job up on herse’f.”</p><p>But Diada had a surprise in store for them all.</p><p>Balancing one of the long saplings on the top of her hand she hurled it like a javelin with the speed and accuracy of an arrow. A hound-dog gave a yelp which seemed to break in two in the middle—then he died. The javelin had pinned him to the ground like an entomologist’s specimen on a cardboard.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then the javelins flew thick and fast into that bunch of dogs, and every flying weapon found a mark and</p>",

The grass was waist high, dead and dry as dust, but it offered no places for concealment, and Diada’s tall form was easily kept in sight.</p><p>At intervals the woman turned and hurled a javelin at the posse, but they were careful to stay out of danger.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In a little while the men noticed that Diada had begun to show signs of exhaustion.

She still carried a few of her javelins, and it was evident that she was now dependent upon them to keep her pursuers at a distance, while both she and they realized that she was now in the center of a prairie of marsh grass where she could not supply herself with new weapons when those she possessed were exhausted.</p><p>Something of the pathos of the situation dawned upon the men, both white and black, and they became silent, eyes strained toward the weakening, staggering quarry, so soon to fall into their hands.</p>",

Again that long, clear whistle came belling across the sun-scorched prairie.</p><p>Diada raised her hands straight up above her head like a sun-worshiper, emitted a long, plaintive, howling scream, which ended with that word which was branded upon the memories of Tickfall forever: “Whoosh! Whoo-ash!”</p><p>So dramatic was her action that the hair stood up  on every man’s head, and a cold chill swept across every sweat-drenched body.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The woman trotted slowly onward, moving now in a straight line toward the river.

A small blue flame curled around her fingers and caught in the dry marsh grass. Running to another point she dropped the flame there.</p><p>Then a wild yell of horror swept across the prairie and she beheld four hundred men in a panic, fleeing for their lives.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Diada was safe from the fire because what little breeze there was blew landward from the lake.

Mounting their horses, they looked across the charred grass of the prairie and beheld Diada trotting slowly onward toward the Mississippi levee.</p><p>With a wild shout they sent their steeds pounding down the road after her.</p><p>Then around the bend of the river came a beautiful sea-going yacht—an exquisite queen of the waters. Her whistle emitted four long, clear signals for the Tickfall landing.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“By George!” Colonel Gaitskill exclaimed, “that is Captain Lemuel Manse’s yacht.

The ringing of the church-bell was a signal for the belated to hasten, and the building was packed with people when Vinegar Atts rose and started a hymn. It was an old, familiar tune to them all, and for a moment the great volume of  sound rolled out of the house and thundered</p>",
  "page-161": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">into the ears of all the white inhabitants of the town.

Never had Vinegar Atts been as earnest in his prayers and exhortations, nor had the people of his parish ever before shown such earnestness in their responses. Every man and woman in the church professed religion that night. Never was a reform as instantaneous and as complete.</p><p>Along toward day the negroes began to rid themselves of their weapons of sin. Figger Bush came to the front of the congregation with the “jerks” and tremblingly laid upon the top of the table a cheap pistol, a pair of brass knucks, and a deck of greasy, soiled playing cards. His example was contagious, and in a few minutes the table was loaded with cards, whisky bottles, dice, brass knucks, daggers, razors, rabbit feet, and hoodoo-charms of all sorts.</p><p>“Cornfess yo’ sins!” Vinegar Atts bellowed. “Cornfess up!”</p>",

Every merchant in the town was beset by applications for labor. Darkies walked from house to house, seeking employment, and every chance pedestrian upon the street was accosted with a greeting which after a  while almost shattered the nerves of the white inhabitants of the village:</p>",
  "page-166": "<p>“Got any wuck fer a strong, willin’ nigger, boss?”</p><p>Of course the negroes spoke not a word which would reveal the reason for this sudden increase in industry, and the white people could only observe the amazing results and wonder.</p><p>Nearly every lawn in Tickfall held a boy busy with tools, cutting the grass, raking the dead leaves, hoeing out the flower-beds, and mending the fences. White people accustomed to seeing a workman take ten minutes to chop down one weed, and half an hour to light his corn-cob pipe, now observed that all were working with feverish haste, and at the same time with the most minute care and exactness as if it were a religious observance of some sort.</p><p>“What ails all these coons in town?” Gaitskill laughed as he looked down the street and saw not a single dusky loafer.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Christmas is coming!” Flournoy laughed. “Day</p>",

Us is  got a notion to waste a lot of whitewash on our fences an’ cabins.”</p><p>“I’ll give the niggers all the lime they need,” Gaitskill said promptly. “Tell ’em to come to this store and get it free!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Hitch Diamond turned and walked hastily down the street. In the next half hour he paid a call at every cabin</p>",
  "page-168": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in all the negro settlements of Tickfall. He pounded on each cabin door with his iron fist, and when the door was opened he entered and looked around.</p><p>“How many niggers lives in dis cabin?” he asked. “How many of dat gang is got ’um a job?”</p><p>When he found a negro who had no employment, he swept down upon him with all the righteous fury of a prophet of old.</p><p>“Whut ails you, nigger? Don’t you know you’s gwine to die? Git ready! Git ready! Go to Marse Tom Gaitskill’s sto’ an’ tell dem white men to gib you a bucket of lime an’ a white-wash brush. Den you white dis cabin, inside an’ out, an’ put whut’s lef’ on dis ole rickety, busted-down fence! Fix de fence up, too!”</p><p>At noon, when Gaitskill passed his store on the way to lunch, a clerk ran out and said:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Colonel, do you really mean for us to give all that lime away? The niggers have carried away forty barrels</p>",
  "page-169": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of whitewash in the last two hours!”</p><p>Gaitskill emitted a sharp whistle of surprise. He scratched his head a moment, then grinned:</p><p>“It’s all right, Frank. Let ’em have it. Christmas is coming!”</p><p>Rev. Vinegar Atts found himself overwhelmed with work. The sudden change in the moral life of his parishioners made a demand upon his services every moment of that busy day. Sick people, who could not come to the church, sent for him to come to see them. Prayer-meetings were held in many of the cabins. A constant stream of people moved in and out of the Shoofly church, and their singing and shouting could be heard for a mile.</p><p>“Git ready to die! Git ready to die!” Vinegar bawled from house to house. “De ancestors will git you ef you don’t watch out!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Under Hitch Diamond’s direction, all the negro</p>",
  "page-170": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">settlements were being whitewashed. Under Vinegar Atts’s admonition the cabins were swept out, the yards were cleaned, the cabins were aired, and every scrap of paper and every particle of trash was gathered up and burned. These were not original ideas with the negroes. They had been taught this in the fever epidemic, when a government health officer had had charge of the sanitary work of the village.</p><p>The village began to fill up with strange darkies who had come in from the plantations and the swamp.</p><p>“Whut you coons doin’ here?” Vinegar Atts demanded of a bunch of them.</p><p>“Us come in whar de dorctors kin git to us easy,” one of them answered nervously. “Word wus sont dat all de niggers is about to die!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Dat’s right!” Vinegar bellowed. “But whut sort of sight will you coons be when you is dead—mud all over yo’ britches an’ no socks on?

He was the only idler in Tickfall, a compulsory idler, for the reform had put him out of business. The sound of the fiddle and the banjo was heard no more. Laughter and shouting had ceased. Not a negro entered his barroom, and most of his regular customers passed on the other side of the street. Skeeter sat in front of his saloon all day in mournful and fearful loneliness.</p><p>Then, just at dark, he had the surprise of his life.</p><p>Three men came up the street and stopped, talked for a moment in low tones, then entered the saloon on tiptoe and came to where Skeeter was sitting behind the bar.</p><p>“Us is a cormittee to wait on you, Skeeter,” Vinegar Atts said in funereal tones.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Whut is I done?” Skeeter asked in a frightened</p>",

I’s seed a whole passel of buzzards sailin’ aroun’ to-day!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The committee moved on, visiting from house to house, admonishing each occupant who had not observed all the rules of reform, just as the white men</p>",
  "page-177": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">had done years before during the fever epidemic.</p><p>Then a totally unexpected thing happened.</p><p>The next day being Christmas Eve, every negro in Tickfall lost his job at noon. All business places were closed, and every man went home to get a good start for the Christmas celebration. Several hundred negroes found themselves with a half-day of idleness confronting them. They cut all the weeds on the streets in all the negro settlements, burned all the trash, put four coats of whitewash on the Shoofly church, mended all the fences, tore down several unsightly shacks which had been decaying in the sun for half a century, dug ditches to drain their  communities, and ceased their work at dark to get supper and assemble in their church, where Vinegar Atts later confronted more work-weary parishioners then he had ever seen before.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the midst of their evening service Skeeter Butts arrived, carrying a bundle of papers almost as large as</p>",
  "page-178": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">himself, which he placed upon a table in front of the pulpit desk.</p><p>This incident was sensational in itself, promising all sorts of fearful possibilities; but the congregation received its greatest jolt when it beheld the Rev. Dr. Sentelle crippling slowly up the aisle behind Skeeter, leaning heavily upon his eleven-pound walking stick.</p><p>Dr. Sentelle was the lion of Tickfall, beloved and magnified by whites and blacks. He was a man of influence and power for miles around. Intense courage glowed in his eyes, which held smoldering flames like the eyes of a jungle beast; tenderness, gentleness, sweetness, and love, love, love were etched in the map of his pain-wrinkled face like an illuminated missal by Bellini; and his beautiful voice was as sweet as music, every spoken word caressing like a woman’s hand.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Bless Gawd!” Vinegar Atts bellowed at sight of the white clergyman. “I capsizes right now in favor of de</p>",
  "page-179": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Revun Dr. Sentelle. He’s gwine fotch us a Chris’mus message!”</p><p>The entire congregation rose to their feet. Vinegar Atts trotted half-way down the aisle and met the cripple. With a murmur of thanks, the white man placed his delicate, blue-veined hand in the crotch of  Vinegar’s powerful arm and stumbled slowly, feebly forward to the pulpit platform. When he had seated himself the negroes sank quietly back upon the benches.</p><p>In the meantime all the business men in Tickfall were holding a meeting in the rear of the Tickfall bank.</p><p>“I propose a basket of grub for every nigger cabin in town!” Gaitskill proclaimed as he sat at the head of the table. “We have no poor whites in this village, but the negroes are always hungry.”</p><p>There was a unanimous murmur of assent.</p><p>Then Gaitskill laughed.</p>",
  "page-180": "<p>“By the way, what has happened to set all the coons to cleaning up? I’ve been too dang liberal with my benefactions—I’m short sixty-two barrels of lime!”</p><p>“Christmas is coming!” several voices murmured, and there were many nodding heads, and a broad grin passed around the table.</p><p>“Say, fellers,” Sheriff Flournoy grinned, rising to his feet and taking a newspaper from his pocket, “er—ah—I beg pardon, are we through with business?”</p><p>“Sure!” Gaitskill smiled. “We’re agreed that the niggers get the grub.”</p><p>“I started a little joke in town the other day,” Flournoy went on.</p><p>Then he explained about the article he had written, and read it aloud to them.</p><p>There was a whoop of laughter, after which one asked:</p><p>“Did you get results?”</p>",
  "page-181": "<p>“No,” Flournoy said disgustedly. “I ought not to have started it with old Isaiah Gaitskill—he’s about half-witted.”</p><p>“By George!” Gaitskill exclaimed, springing to his feet. “That accounts for all this cleaning up and whitewash—the niggers are expecting an epidemic of disease and are getting ready to die!”</p><p>Perfect silence greeted this announcement as its full significance dawned upon each man. Then Dr. Moseley, the parish health officer, spoke earnestly:</p><p>“Gentlemen, let us not say one word to the contrary. Let the darkies clean up and keep clean!”</p><p>“I have done good by stealth and blush to find it fame!” Flournoy interrupted mockingly.</p><p>“It means health, gentlemen,” Dr. Moseley declared. “Health and long life to us all—er—by the way, I propose that as a toast right now!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For nearly forty years Gaitskill had held this meeting</p>",
  "page-182": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in the rear of his bank on every Christmas Eve. The men were familiar with his custom, and the physician’s suggestion met with instant response.</p><p>Gaitskill rose, unlocked his desk, pushed back the top, and the men gazed with lively anticipation upon the glasses and decanters there concealed.</p><p>“Hitch!” Gaitskill called. “Oh, Hitch Diamond! Come here!”</p><p>There was no answer. Hitch had long before deserted the colonel and gone to the Shoofly church.</p><p>“I bet that coon answers promptly to-morrow morning,” Gaitskill laughed as he grumblingly filled the glasses.</p><p>“Christmas is coming!” a laughing chorus murmured.</p><p>Suddenly there was a shout which rolled like thunder over Tickfall, the sound permeating even the thick walls of the Tickfall bank.</p>",
  "page-183": "<p>“Listen to the niggers!” Flournoy grinned.</p><p>There was a moment’s silence; then the mighty ululations of a negro song floated to them on the wings of the wind. The men arose.</p><p>“Health and long life to us all!” Dr. Moseley repeated.</p><p>“To us all!” the men murmured with nodding heads. Then they drank.</p><p>Time inevitably weakens all reforms. It robs the greatest and most imminent danger of its terror. And time completely overthrew the reform in Tickfall and so endowed the negroes with courage that any timid darky would have tickled the whiskers of a bearcat with the end of his flat nose.</p><p>The time required to accomplish this relapse was one day—the day which comes but once a year—Christmas!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The day found every negro in Tickfall in a receptive</p>",

As a result, every white man in the town had the privilege of a few moments’ conversation with all the blacks in the town some time during the day.</p><p>The sun-slashed streets of Tickfall were filled with them, moving to and fro, like ants in a hill, all feverish in their activity, and all so shoutingly happy that the town was as noisy as a parrot’s cage.</p><p>Their order of advance was something like this:</p><p>a The servants of the household.<br>b Those who had been servants during the year.<br>c Servants of former years.<br>d Those who had done odd jobs.<br>e Those whose names the white man knew.<br>f Those who knew the white man’s name.<br>g All the other niggers in town.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And each white man had supplied himself with about half a barrel of cheap candy, three or four bunches of bananas, a barrel of apples, a hatful of small</p>",

The slaughter had begun again. With another groan he dropped his head and gave himself up to deep thought.</p><p>A sharp crack of hickory against horsehide—Skeeter looked up and saw the Tickfall center-fielder fumbling with the ball, picking it up and dropping it three times, while four hilarious Sawtown men came in and scored.</p><p>Skeeter rose to his feet, dusted the seat of his duck trousers, and said to Coco:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Little gal, you set right here till I gits back.

Then he gave himself up to thought.</p><p>“Let me see,” he said. “Do you know I forgot to ask that negro what woman he was going to marry?”</p><p>He struck another match and lighted his cigar.

  "page-315": "<p>“Eve’ything is done sot an’ settled,” Tick grinned back. “Dat piece of love lesson you gimme wus suttinly a plenty.”</p><p>“You oughter stayed through it all, honey,” Dazzle smiled. “I’d ’a’ learnt you how to flash de glad eye, how to hold yo’ gal’s hand, how to hug her so tight she’d holler fer her mammy, an’ how to bite yo’ name in her cheek.”</p><p>“I didn’t need dat many lessons,” Tick informed her.</p><p>“Rememberin’ dat you ain’t paid me nothin’ fer whut I did learn you, it seems nachel to me dat you oughter buy me somepin to eat,” Dazzle suggested.</p><p>“Dat’ll suit me,” Tick exclaimed. “I ain’t got de same five dollars whut you gib me back, but I got anodder five whut is jes’ as good.”</p><p>It did not occur to Tick until afterward that it is not wise to tell an actress how much money you have in your possession when you take her out to supper.</p>",
  "page-316": "<p>Dazzle revealed a perfectly amazing appetite for both food and drink. She wanted her food cooked in sundry unique and most expensive ways, and she wanted a mixture of drinks which were several times as expensive as any that Tick had ever had to pay for.</p><p>For two hours they sat at the table laughing and talking, and Dazzle found that she had merely to flatter  Tick about his social accomplishments to get him to go the limit financially.</p><p>Finally Dazzle announced that she had to go, and refused to let Tick accompany her to her destination.</p><p>Left alone in the restaurant, Tick counted his change and found that less than fifty cents remained of the five dollars which Skeeter had lent him.</p><p>He left the restaurant, entered a nearby saloon, and invested some more of his money in drink. When he reappeared upon the street he possessed one silver dime and a jag.</p>",
  "page-317": "<p>“Huh,” he grunted, as he looked down at the battered dime. “I’s suttinly pretty well ’luminated up to now. Wonder how come I still got dis here little dime? I b’lieve I’ll buy a watermellyum.”</p><p>He entered the restaurant again, purchased a large melon, and staggered solemnly down the street, hugging it in his arms. He walked into a little grove of trees and sat down on the ground.</p><p>By this time his ideas were extremely vague.</p><p>He cut his watermelon in two halves, carving across the middle; he surveyed both ends with ludicrous gravity, cogitating deeply.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then remembering that he had left his hat in the Shin Bone eating-house, he scooped all the red meat out of one end of his melon, and turned the empty rind over his head, fitting it on his skull like a cap! Thinking at the same time that he needed a chair, he scooped the red meat out of the other end of the melon, and sat</p>",
  "page-318": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">down in that half of the empty rind. Having made himself comfortable, he proceeded with his meal!</p><p>“Hey!” he bawled to the world at large. “Dinner’s ready! Come an’ git it!”</p><p>The thunder roared, and a summer shower, driven before a strong Gulf breeze, swept over Tickfall. It was gone in five minutes, and the moon came out clear and bright, but the rain had drenched Tick Hush to the skin.</p><p>“It’s a good thing I fotch my hat out here wid me,” he mumbled, holding the watermelon rind on his head. “I mought ketch cold ef my head gits wet. Gotter take keer of myse’f—gwine git married.”</p><p>The cold water had a slightly sobering effect upon him, and he suddenly realized that he was without his coat.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Dar now! I done lef’ dat coat at Button Hook’s house, an’ I done decided not to marrify Button. Dat’s</p>",
  "page-319": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">bad luck! I’ll go ax Skeeter Butts ’bout dat!”</p><p>Still holding his watermelon-rind hat upon his wabbly head, he staggered slowly down the street, balancing himself carefully as he walked up the steps of the saloon and entered the swinging door.</p><p>Then he stumbled and threw out both hands to steady himself. His unique hat fell to the floor breaking into a hundred fragments, and splashing to all parts of the room. Tick gave a low moan of sorrow, stepped on a piece of the melon, slid about ten feet, and sat down upon the floor with a jolt which almost loosened his ears.</p><p>He got to his feet with difficulty, motioned mysteriously to Skeeter, and led the way to the room in the rear.</p><p>“Bad luck, Skeeter!” he growled. “I done messed my mattermony up agin.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Slop it out!” Skeeter snapped. “Whut you done</p>",
  "page-320": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">now?”</p><p>“Button Hook is done promise to marry me, an’ Limit Lark is done promise to marry me, an’ Dazzle Zenor is done promise to marry me—leastwise, I think she done it. I cain’t remember real good.”</p><p>“Why cain’t you remember?” Skeeter snarled.</p><p>“I’s so full of booze my y-ears is stopped up an’ my back teeth is a-floatin’,” Tick explained.</p><p>“I know dat! Go on!”</p><p>“Whut griefs my mind is dis,” Tick went on. “I lef’ my coat wid dem two marrifyin’ letters in it down at Button’s house; Button is got my wrist-watch, an’ I ain’t gwine marry Button!”</p><p>“Aw, good gosh!” Skeeter exclaimed disgustedly.</p><p>“Whut is de most properest thing fer me to do nex’, Skeeter?” Tick inquired with alcoholic gravity.</p><p>“You better do like a mud-turtle do!” Skeeter snarled.</p>",
  "page-321": "<p>“How do a mud-turtle ack under dem succumstances?” Tick inquired.</p><p>“When a turtle gits in trouble, he puts his hands an’ foots in his pocket, takes a big breath, an’ swallers his head, den he rolls offen a log an’ stays under de water fer fawty days,” Skeeter informed him.</p><p>“Dat’s onpossible fer me to do, Skeeter,” Tick replied earnestly. “I’d git drowndead shore, an’ Marse Tom don’t want no harm to happen to me.”</p><p>“’Twouldn’t be no great big loss,” Skeeter snapped.  “It ’pears to me like I could do widout you powerful easy.”</p><p>“De lady folks would miss me,” Tick said with a drunken grin.</p><p>“Git outen here, Tick, befo’ I git you put in jail,” Skeeter howled. “You is a noosunce.”</p><p>“Don’t go back on yo’ lodge brudder, Skeeter,” Tick begged. “Tell me whut to do to git outen my jam.”</p>",
  "page-322": "<p>“All right,” Skeeter said ungraciously. “Go down to Button Hook an’ git yo’ coat, yo’ letters, an’ yo’ wrist-watch back—an’ I hopes to Gawd dat Button Hook will chaw you up an’ spit you out!”</p><p>“Marse Tom don’t want his pest-house nigger ruint like dat!” Tick protested.</p><p>Skeeter pushed him out of the back door and returned to the barroom.</p><p>Thus dismissed, Tick went slowly toward the cabin occupied by Button Hook. Then he thought of something which quickened his footsteps and gave him courage.</p><p>“I won’t hab no trouble to git my coat back. I jumped through dat winder an’ busted it to smashereens, an’ of co’se it will be open.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He sneaked up to the house from the side nearest to the woods, and approached the window with the utmost caution. Climbing in over the broken frame, he</p>",
  "page-323": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">felt about the room until he located his coat. Thrusting his hand into the inside pocket, he brought it out empty.</p><p>“Dey’s gone!” he sighed. “Mo’ an’ mo’ trouble all de time!”</p><p>He stood thinking and listening until his attention was attracted by the loud ticking of a clock in the room.</p><p>“I gitcher!” he grinned. “Button said she hid de wrist-watch behime de clock.”</p><p>He thrust his hand between the wall and the clock, and in a hollow space behind the timepiece, he found the watch and the two envelopes.</p><p>“Huh,” he grunted, “dese here is shore my losted letters. De Lawd am shorely wid me.”</p><p>Climbing cautiously and noiselessly out of the window, he walked out of the front gate, and, all danger being over, he started jauntily down the street. He felt care-free and happy once more, and he began to sing.</p>",
  "page-324": "<p>Several hundred yards down the road Button Hook heard him, and concealed herself behind a clump of bushes. She carried a double-barreled, muzzle-loading shotgun, and she had the face and manner of one who was determined to use it.</p><p>Button had been hunting through all the negro settlements of the town for the man who was now approaching, singing at the top of his voice. She listened to the song with an ugly smile upon her lips:</p><p>“Look on de sunny side,<br>Git on de sunny side,<br>Stay on de sunny side<br>Of life!”</p><p>The song ended in a howl of fright.</p><p>Tick Hush came to a stand with both hands outstretched to ward off the attack of a girl who stood in  the middle of the moonlit road with a shotgun at her shoulder.</p>",
  "page-325": "<p>“Git ready to die, Ticky!” she snarled. “Dis am de end of you!”</p><p>Then both barrels of the gun went off at about the same time.</p><p>Tick went off, too.</p><p>Fortunately for Tick, Button Hook was not familiar with the use of firearms. She had heard her father say that his old shotgun kicked like a yearling mule. She was afraid of the gun, afraid of the noise it made, and afraid of the kick. She had held it far from her shoulder to avoid the rebound, had shut both her eyes, and pulled both triggers. When the gun went off she dropped it on the ground, and went home at full speed, squalling at every step.</p><p>Tick leaped to one side of the road, tore both legs off his pantaloons at the knee clambering over a barbed-wire fence, and went howling through the woods, bumping against nearly every tree in his flight.</p>",
  "page-326": "<p>Like a crawfish, Tick went forward and looked back.</p><p>When at last he felt that he had escaped from danger, he was bleeding from a number of wounds on his head, bleeding at both knees, bleeding where the barbed-wire had cut his lips, and his nose was a spouting fountain of red.</p><p>“I’ll go ax Skeeter Butts ’bout dis,” the wretched man moaned.</p><p>When he staggered into the Hen-Scratch saloon he made a big sensation. Negroes were standing at  the bar, others were playing pool, some were engaged at various games at the table, and a big group was assembled in the center of the room singing, cracking jokes, and laughing as they smoked. The crowd sprang up and rushed forward as Tick stumbled in, sobbing like a little child.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“My Gawd, niggers!” he howled. “Marse Tom is got to git him anodder nigger.

  "page-329": "<p>Skeeter Butts talked excitedly over the telephone and five minutes later a big automobile stopped in front of his place, and Dr. Moseley came in.</p><p>“Get all these niggers out of here, Skeeter!” he commanded sharply. “Clear the house!”</p><p>The negroes tramped out of the door like a drove of horses going through a gap, and then they scattered  to all parts of the town to carry the dreadful news.</p><p>Dr. Moseley’s examination failed to find a single gunshot wound.</p><p>“You are not shot, Tick,” Moseley said. “You’ve been lying to these friends of yours. Somebody beat you over the head with a club.”</p><p>“Naw, suh; dat warn’t it, doc,” Tick insisted. “I wus shotted wid bofe barrels of a shotgun!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Tick don’t know whut happened, doc,” Skeeter commented. “He come in here ’bout a hour ago so full of booze dat he sloshed like a water-wagon when he</p>",

  "page-331": "<p>Skeeter ran across lots to his home on the premises of Sheriff John Flournoy.</p><p>Flournoy had a little automobile, which he used for fishing and hunting trips, and Skeeter pushed this out of the garage, cranked it, and jumped to the seat. In a few minutes he was back again at the saloon.</p><p>“Climb in dis machine, Ticky,” he commanded. “A leetle fresh air will rest yo’ mind an’ do you good. Git in!”</p><p>Then Skeeter steered the machine straight toward the home of Button Hook. Tick uttered angry and frightened protests, but in vain. Skeeter persisted in his plan.</p><p>“Dis is whar it happened, Skeeter,” Tick said as they passed a place in the road. “Dis is whar I wus shotted!”</p><p>“Whoa!” Skeeter said, as he brought the car to a stop. “Look dar—dat is de gun whut Button drapped!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Placing the gun in the machine, Skeeter hurried on</p>",

He heard shuffling noises with low talking, and movements which indicated that the occupants of the house were waking from sleep and getting out of bed.</p><p>“Who dar?” old man Hook inquired in a frightened voice.</p><p>“Open up!” Skeeter yelled. “I got a little word  wid you an’ Button Hook from Sheriff John Flournoy an’ Doc Moseley.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">At this there was a frightened squeal from Button Hook, excited voices talking, swift movement of feet, and the door opened a little crack.

I reckon him an’ Marse Tom Gaitskill will come right down an’ cornverse you-all about it.

  "page-335": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">hidden behind the same stump which had served him when he delivered the wrist-watch to Button Hook. As Skeeter cranked the machine, Tick emerged from his hiding-place and climbed back into the car.</p><p>“Now, Ticky,” Skeeter said when they were once more in the saloon and had sat down. “A long time befo’ mawnin’, Button Hook an’ all dat crowd will be gittin’ to some place fur away in a mighty big hurry. Dey’ll trabble wid a looseness, an’ dey won’t look back, an’ dey won’t never come back.”</p><p>“Dey won’t make me mad ef dey stays away,” Tick spoke, trying to grin through his cut and plaster-covered lips.</p><p>“Dat saves yo’ life, an’ it gits you good riddunce of one of yo’ to-be wives!”</p><p>“Thank ’e, suh,” Tick said gratefully. “You shore is a noble nigger man!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“You tole me dat Dazzle promise to marry you—is</p>",

Then he found a button in the rear and undid</p>",
  "page-375": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">it. The clothes fell off of little Ready Rocket like the last leaf off of a tree, leaving the limbs bare.</p><p>“Dar now!” Skeeter snickered. “Ain’t dat funny!

On Ready’s left arm he found an ugly scar.</p><p>“Looks like a fresh vaccinate mark to me,” he muttered. “I mighty nigh fergot whut Happy tole me ’bout dat sore arm.”</p><p>He brought a bright red stick of candy out of his pocket and placed it in Ready Rocket’s willing hand.</p><p>“Now, sonny,” he whispered. “You suck dat sugar-stick an’ fergit dat I is changin’ yo’ clothes.

A quarter of a mile had been covered in this way when Ready Rocket dropped his candy.</p><p>“Ah-hah!” Skeeter said, as he picked up the sticky candy, wiped a little of the sand and dust off it, and stuck it back in Ready’s gaping mouth. “Dat’s a good sign—you is gittin’ tired an’ sleepy.”</p>",
  "page-377": "<p>They turned around and started back toward the saloon, Skeeter pressing the boy to walk as fast as he could. Half a dozen times in the return walk the little fellow dropped his candy and finally Skeeter grew tired of Ready’s carelessness.

Skeeter dragged him for a few steps by the arm. Then he lifted the sleeping child, carried him to a ragged quilt in a corner of the rear room, and laid him down.

The practised eyes of the negroes recognized the signs of danger. They knew Shin was out to kill. Some slipped away, and all the others became perfectly quiet.

With a loud grunt he stooped over the soiled quilt where Ready Rocket lay. With a louder grunt, he lifted the boy in his arms, and Skeeter heard him stagger to the door and close it quietly behind him.</p><p>A few minutes later Skeeter heard a loud wail down the street, and broke into a broad grin.</p><p>“I reckin Shin is done fell on Ready Rocket an’ squshed him; mebbe he’s done squoze Ready’s sore arm; mebbe Ready’s got de colics—I hopes so.

  "page-389": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">found him in the swamp, a little naked baby crawling through the high marsh grass, mewing like a little blind kitten. He hurried around the house to the garage and opened the doors as noiselessly as he could. He had determined to use a little runabout which Flournoy kept for his fishing and hunting trips. In this machine he could go to the hog-camp, get Whiffle Bone’s baby, and return in a very short time.</p><p>He pushed the little runabout out of the garage, pushed it down the hill in the rear of the house, cranked it, sprang into the seat, and drove through a back pasture, out of a gate, and onto the rear street. He took one fearful look behind him and saw with gratification that no light had flashed up in Flournoy’s house to show that the occupants had been disturbed by his intrusion upon the property.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Skeeter shot through the white portion of the town, and turned into the lanes of Dirty-Six at a perilous</p>",
  "page-390": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">speed. His dilapidated machine was rattling and squeaking a loud protest at every turn, but Skeeter did not heed the warning.</p><p>Then as Skeeter passed Pap Curtain’s house, a tire burst with a loud explosion, the runabout careened perilously, and before Skeeter could stop, it leaped from the road, crashed through Pap Curtain’s fence,  and came to a halt within a few steps of Pap’s porch.</p><p>In the silence which followed, Skeeter heard a woman in Pap’s cabin whooping like a siren in a fog.</p><p>“Aw, shut up!” Skeeter snapped. “You ain’t in no danger. <em>I’s</em> de coon whut oughter be howlin’.”</p><p>He leaped out of the machine, snatched open the tool box, wrenched off an extra tire from the rear of the car and began to make repairs.</p><p>The door opened and Whiffle Bone stepped out upon the porch!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Bless gracious, Whiffle!” Skeeter exclaimed in a glad</p>",
  "page-391": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">voice, as he worked with furious haste adjusting his new tire. “I thought you wus out at de hog-camp. Whar is little Shinny Bone?”</p><p>This question started another series of howls, and Skeeter had his tire fitted and was ready to crank his car before Whiffle had calmed down to where she could answer.</p><p>“Little Shinny has went!” Whiffle screamed. “I decided not to go to de hog-camp beca’se it wus so fur. I tried to keep little Shinny hid in dis cabin.

I’ll go git Ready  Rocket an’ fetch little Shinny back in less’n a minute!”</p><p>“I’ll git little Shinny fust,” Skeeter decided as he shot down the street. He stopped his automobile a block away from Mustard Prophet’s house, ran down the street, and slipped into a little side yard by climbing the fence.</p><p>Hopey and Happy were in the kitchen, and Skeeter heard Hopey’s loud voice:</p><p>“’Tain’t no good fer you to howl, Happy.

  "page-393": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">did not have the child in the kitchen with them. He stepped around the house, tiptoed up to the porch, and lo! the boy lay asleep upon the bed just inside of the open door.</p><p>“Dat gits me straight in dis bizzness,” Skeeter grinned, as he slipped into the room and lifted the sleeping child. “I’m shorely got de Lawd wid me dis time. Nobody cain’t git dis pickaninny away from me widout plenty compelment!”</p><p>He deposited Shinny in the machine, spun down the street to the Bone eating-house, and once more stopped his car a block away.</p><p>“Shin’s got killin’ on de brain,” he muttered.  “I’s gwine spy aroun’ a little befo’ I crowds him too close.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Shin Bone was seated alone in the middle of his restaurant which was lighted up like a circus. He was lining out a church hymn, singing it at the top of his voice, and beating the time with a large tin coffee pot.</p>",
  "page-394": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">He had pounded the table with his tin pot until it was a certainty that it would never serve its original purpose again.</p><p>“I guess little Ready is sleepin’ in de back room,” Skeeter remarked, as he slipped around to the rear.</p><p>He entered the open door and found the child lying upon the bed which was usually occupied by Shin Bone’s real son. Carefully lifting the little fellow, Skeeter walked quickly down the street, grinning exultantly as he listened to Shin Bone’s raucous voice singing:</p><p>“O heaben’s mighty nigh,<br>Mighty nigh, mighty nigh,<br>Ef you got a eye fer visions<br>In de sky, in de sky!”</p><p>When young Ready lay beside Shin Bone’s boy in the automobile, Skeeter felt almost happy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“It ’pears to me like I got dis job by de tail wid a downhill pull!” he exulted, as he started his machine</p>",
  "page-395": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and drove away from Dirty-Six with a lighter heart.</p><p>“I’se gwine take dese babies to my cabin,” he decided. “Dem squallin’ womans kin wait fer deir brats—dey don’t ’preciate whut I done fer ’em nohow. But Marse John might git peeved up ef he  missed dis automobile an’ I cain’t affode to git in no lawsuit wid de cotehouse.”</p><p>Entering Sheriff John Flournoy’s yard, Skeeter Butts drove his little rattling runabout up the asphalt runway toward the garage in as nearly perfect silence as he could command.</p><p>Quickly he dismounted and pushed the little machine back where it belonged. Then he lifted the sleeping children out of the machine and started toward his own cabin.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Instantly a long shaft of white light shot across his path and he scampered out of the way, hiding behind some shrubbery which grew close to the house. He</p>",
  "page-396": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">looked down the runway and his hair stood on end.</p><p>Flournoy’s big automobile was coming up the drive, its powerful light turning from side to side, illuminating every inch of the way. Skeeter did not know what moment a turn of the wheel would cause the light to flash across his body, so he slipped along the side of the house out to the front.</p><p>Alas! Standing at the front gate where she had just left the car was Mrs. Flournoy, and the electric light upon the corner made the front lawn as bright as day.</p><p>Skeeter noted that Mrs. Flournoy’s back was turned to him, so he scampered up the front steps and entered the front door just as Mrs. Flournoy turned to come up the walk.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Flournoy never thought of locking his house for the reason that half a dozen bloodhounds were running at large on his lawn all the time. For a moment,  because of this fact, Skeeter had escaped observation. What to do</p>",
  "page-397": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">next was his problem.</p><p>The house was perfectly familiar to Skeeter. He could have gone all over it with his eyes shut. And he was perfectly welcome there night and day, for he had been coming and going in that house for twenty-five years with no one to question his actions. But he had no desire to be caught in that house with two strange babies in his arms!</p><p>The front door opened and Mrs. Flournoy entered, snapping on the electric light in the reception-room. Skeeter retreated to the dining-rooms still hugging the two children in his wearying arms.</p><p>“Huh,” he muttered to himself. “Dese folks always gits somepin to eat befo’ dey goes to bed. I better git outen dis dinin’-room!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He was just in time, too, for the doors to the dining-room slid open just as Skeeter stepped into a little back hall, which contained a narrow staircase leading to the</p>",
  "page-398": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">second story. Skeeter tiptoed up the steps. His idea was to wait until the folks had entered the dining-room, then go down the front stairs, out of the front door and around to his cabin.</p><p>But luck was against him!</p><p>At the top of the steps he paused to rest his arms and get another grip upon the children he was carrying. He laid the boys side by side, took one under each arm like a bundle, and started on. Then it happened. He attempted to enter a narrow door and a little woolly nigger head hit the sharp edge of the door jamb on each side with a thump!</p><p>The two pickaninnies let out a howl which turned Skeeter’s blood to ice water.</p><p>Any effort toward concealment was useless now, and Skeeter was consumed with desire to get out of that house. He galloped down the front steps, turned into the rear hall, and stepped out upon a side porch.</p>",
  "page-399": "<p>Sheriff John Flournoy met him at the steps!</p><p>Flournoy turned the electric flashlight he had been using at the garage into Skeeter’s face, and the blinded, terrified darky reeled backward and dropped the two howling nigger babies upon the porch floor.</p><p>“Turn on the light, Skeeter!” Flournoy commanded.</p><p>Skeeter reached up above his head and switched on an electric light suspended from a cord.</p><p>Flournoy looked down at the howling nigger babies and grinned. He saw nothing unusual in the fact that Skeeter was coming out of his home at eleven o’clock at night, for Mrs. Flournoy had left Skeeter in charge of the house a thousand times in their absence. Nor did the two black babies excite anything more than amusement, for several negro families lived on his place and their cabins were full of children.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Did you steal those nigger babies, Skeeter?” Flournoy drawled in his easy, smiling way. The remark</p>",
  "page-400": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was merely to make talk.</p><p>“Naw, suh,” Skeeter stammered. “Naw, suh!”</p><p>“I’m glad to hear you say that,” Flournoy chuckled. “Since the Lamana kidnaping case, the Legislature has passed a law making the penalty for stealing children very severe in Louisiana.”</p><p>Skeeter attempted to moisten his parched lips with a dry tongue. Then he asked through jaws which felt like they were locked:</p><p>“Whut—whut—whut am de penalty, Marse John?”</p><p>“_Death!_” the sheriff answered.</p><p>Then an oath of surprise popped from his throat. Skeeter had crumpled like a broken weed and had fallen face downward between the two squalling black babies.</p><p>Flournoy leaped forward and turned the prostrate man over on his back.</p><p>The negro had fainted.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mrs. Flournoy appeared upon the side porch and</p>",
  "page-401": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">quieted the babies by the simple process of giving each of them a piece of fried chicken.</p><p>Sheriff Flournoy as quickly restored Skeeter to consciousness by pouring cold water on his head and hot liquor down his throat.</p><p>Then leaving the babies to play under the electric light upon the porch, they conducted Skeeter to the kitchen and demanded explanations.</p><p>Nobody can beat a negro making explanations.</p><p>Skeeter’s statement was utterly untrue, but when we remember that the frightened darky considered that he had been guilty of the crime of kidnaping and was hopefully attempting to save himself from the penalty of death, all kind-hearted persons will forgive him. Most of us would stretch the blanket just a little if by doing so we could save our lives.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“It happened dis way, Marse John,” Skeeter said  in a trembling voice. “I wus givin’ dem two little black</p>",

The grapevine telephone carried the news that Shin Bone had stolen Happy Rocket’s baby. A little later the message ran along the same mysterious channel that Happy Rocket had stolen Shin Bone’s baby. Then the startling information came that some party or parties unknown had stolen Shin Bone’s baby out of Happy Rocket’s cabin.</p><p>This was enough to bring the entire population of Dirty-Six out of their cabins into the street. They streamed up and down the narrow lanes, jabbering, gesticulating, telling again and again of the fight between Whiffle Bone and Happy Rocket, of the divorce of Shin and Whiffle, of the drunken spree of Shin Bone.</p>",
  "page-405": "<p>The general idea prevailed that Shin Bone had possession of both babies, but no one cared to go and inquire while Shin was crazy drunk, singing “heavy religion” songs, and pounding the table with a tin coffee pot.</p><p>Then Whiffle Bone caused a sensation by leaving her uncle Pap Curtain’s cabin and running down the  street toward the Bone eating-house squalling like a catamount. Dozens of negroes fell into her wake and followed at a safe distance.</p><p>As they approached the restaurant they all recognized with pleasure that Shin Bone was sobering up. The best indication of this improvement was the character of songs he was singing. He had abandoned the heavy religion tunes, his voice had lost some of its volume, and the music was gay and lightsome:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“De boss he squall to de nigger boys:<br>‘Don’t bother dat jug in de</p>",

  "page-414": "<p>Tears of weakness and nervous collapse came into  his eyes and rolled down his cheeks to the corners of his mouth.

He tried to take his mind off of the book, but the interpretations of his dreams constantly recurred to his mind, and he felt a growing uneasiness.</p><p>“I wonder who dem secret enemies is,” he sighed. “Dat book oughter had tole me mo’ ’bout dat.”</p><p>He counted off upon his fingers all the negroes whom he did not like; then he counted those whom he knew did not like him; then he exclaimed:</p><p>“Dat don’t he’p me none. Ef I knows deir names, of co’se dey ain’t really secret enemies!”</p><p>He sat down at a table, lighted another cigarette, let the hot ash fall from the end and set his trousers  afire. Then he dropped his smoke, put out the fire, and viewed the damage with popping eyeballs.</p>",
  "page-421": "<p>“Dat’s a <em>bad</em> sign,” he exclaimed. “A nigger ain’t in luck whut sets his pants on fire!”</p><p>He got up and walked toward the rear exit of the saloon, traveling with jerky, nervous steps, and looking behind him twice with a frightened glance. He seated himself again in the shade of the chinaberry tree, and the book lay upon the chair which his friend had vacated.</p><p>Skeeter eyed the volume a long time with increasing uneasiness. The gaudy red-cover design represented a red woman, propped up on some red pillows, asleep, and holding a red fan in her hand. In the background was another red woman waving a wand, and a winged white boy, holding a black hat in one hand and a bag of money in the other. Scattered about on the red woman’s red couch were playing cards, envelopes, and one square piece of paper which contained the numbers, “--.”</p>",
  "page-422": "<p>“I onderstan’s dem numbers,” Skeeter mumbled to himself. “Whar is -?”</p><p>Skeeter lighted another cigarette and puffed it furiously. Twice he reached out his hand to take the book, then drew back without touching it. He looked away several times, but the gaudy cover design attracted him each time with a sort of hypnotic fascination.</p><p>“I hadn’t oughter bought dis book,” he sighed. “A nigger ain’t in luck ef he knows too much about his innards.”</p><p>Finally he overcame his fear to the point where he  ventured to turn the cover, and lo! on the other side was the picture of an aged negro, his black face framed in white hair and beard, his spectacles pushed up on his flat forehead, his mouth spread wide in a snaggle-toothed laugh.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“My Gawd!” Skeeter exclaimed, springing to his feet and gazing at the face with a fear which made his lips</p>",
  "page-423": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">tremble, and his hands shake, and his knees knock together. “Dar’s a tintype of ol’ Swampo, dat wild Affican nigger whut used to live in a holler sycamo’ tree in de Little Moccasin Swamp!”</p><p>He sat down, resting his elbows on his knees and his face in his hands. For five minutes he strove to recall all that he knew and had heard of Swampo.</p><p>He remembered the leering, leathery, wrinkled face of the old half-wit negro, who came to town on every Saturday afternoon, and smirked and bowed and scraped around the white folks, holding out a clawlike hand, begging for a few pennies. Once he had heard a fearful screaming among the blue jays in the swamp, and had crept through the high undergrowth to see what the trouble was; and lo! Swampo had caught a blue jay, had laid the bird on its back, and had pinioned its wings to the ground with forked sticks.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The bird’s horrible screams had brought all the jays</p>",
  "page-424": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">in that part of the swamp to the spot, and they stood around the imprisoned bird, making loud and profane comments upon his unfortunate predicament. At intervals some blue jay, impelled by curiosity, walked up within reach of the captive bird’s claws. Instantly the captive reached out, seized  the bird, and held him a prisoner until Swampo slunk out of the underbrush, grinning like an ape, and released it!</p><p>As he thought about this fearful scene, Skeeter’s hair stood up on end, just as it had years before when he witnessed it, and had crawled, terrified, away from that vicinity. A cold shiver passed over his sweat-drenched body; he raised his head and eyed Swampo’s wide, laughing mouth with superstitious awe.</p><p>“Swampo shore is got de laugh on me,” he muttered through chattering teeth. “I wish dat nigger hadn’t sold me dis book. I ain’t no scholard!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lighting one cigarette after another to bolster up his</p>",
  "page-425": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">courage, he managed at last to put out a trembling finger and turn the book over so he could read the title-page. With the greatest difficulty he spelled it out, giving the peculiar negro pronunciation to the words as he uttered them:</p><p>“‘Af-ric-an Dream Book an’ Fortune Teller, containin’ de true in-ter-pre-ta-tion of dreams, an’ de numbers of de events to which dey ap-ply.

Half dem words don’t signify nothin’!”</p><p>For ten minutes he walked up and down under the trees muttering to himself, his face fear-stricken, his hands trembling, his body oozing with cold sweat.</p>",
  "page-426": "<p>Then with a mighty resolution he reached out for the book, folded it, and slipped it into his hip pocket.</p><p>“Dis book is done skeart me plum’ to death,” he sighed. “Ef I die, I’ll go to hell! I wonder whar Revun Vinegar Atts is at? I’s gwine to talk dis over wid some religium pusson!”</p><p>The Rev.

I needs all I’m got.”</p><p>Skeeter looked him over and grinned. For a moment he forgot his fears in contemplation of this squat-legged, pot-bellied, moon-faced negro preacher, whose head was bald except for two tufts of hair, one over each ear, which made him resemble a mule wearing a blind bridle.</p>",
  "page-427": "<p>“You shore is spreadin’ yo’se’f out, Elder,” Skeeter said, as he set his chair close beside Vinegar. “You look like a buzzard whut is tryin’ to fly back’ards an’ upside down at de same time.”</p><p>“I’s like a watermillyum vine,” Vinegar boomed. “When I gits sot good, I begins to spraddle.”</p><p>Skeeter reached to his hip pocket and brought out his dream book.</p><p>“Whut you flashin’ dat book aroun’ fer, Skeeter?” Atts asked suspiciously. “De Bible say dat many study is weary on de flesh.”</p><p>“I needs some advices from a scholard,” Skeeter remarked as he lighted a cigarette. “I done smoked  up a whole pack of dese here things in de las’ half-hour.

I’ll be skeart to go to bed at night!

  "page-433": "<p>“Don’t you say nothin’ ’bout dat book till I borrers his rabbit foot, Skeeter!” Vinegar admonished in a low tone as the two watched Figger’s approach.</p><p>A moment later, Vinegar said:</p><p>“Figger, ain’t you got no luck-charms or rabbit foots dat you kin loant me fer a little while?”</p><p>“Naw,” Figger grinned. “Dey don’t do no good.

The other two looked upon him with pity and compassion, trembling at the dire portent of their own dreams and entering into full fellowship of sympathy with Figger. They sat for a few minutes in silence, then Skeeter Butts announced:</p><p>“I reckin I better mosey back to de Hen-Scratch.”</p><p>“Us is gwine wid you, Skeeter,” the other two announced promptly. “We is all sons of sorrer, an’ we oughter stick togedder.”</p><p>At the Hen-Scratch saloon they found Hitch Diamond, Prince Total, and Pap Curtain.</p><p>“Whut ails you-alls?” Hitch inquired curiously as he gazed into the frightened faces of his three friends. “You niggers look like you is jes’ foun’ out you wus borned to die!”</p>",
  "page-436": "<p>“Dat’s a fack, Hitch,” Skeeter sighed, as he and his two companions seated themselves on a bench. “Us is all had bad dreams.”</p><p>“I had a dream las’ night,” Hitch announced in his deep, rumbling bass. “I dreamed I runned a donkey down an’ tied him to a tree, an’ he brayed all night.

  "page-437": "<p>As Hitch Diamond received this intelligence he was a study for the psychologist.

He jiggered nervously with his ponderous feet, kicking up tiny clouds of sand from the sun-scorched earth. His pipe lay upon the ground by his chair where it had dropped unnoticed when he attempted to put it in his pocket. Skeeter Butts came out of the saloon, carrying his chair. He placed it beside the fat preacher, lighted a cigarette and entered with Vinegar into the silent fellowship of sympathy and understanding.</p><p>After a long silence Vinegar said mournfully:</p><p>“I cogitate dat they done deeprive me of my goat, Skeeter.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Yes, sur; dat’s so, suh.

He picked up his pipe from the ground, filled it with strong perique tobacco,  lighted it, then let the bowl drop off of the stem, scattering the ashes over his lap and spilling the tobacco. Not noticing the accident, Vinegar sucked vigorously on the stem, and gave himself up to gloomy meditations.</p><p>“I been de pasture of de Shoofly church fer twenty year hand-runnin’, Skeeter,” Vinegar remarked at last. “I begged de loose change outen de pockets of de white folks to build dat church.

Skeeter fiddled with a brass wrist-watch which he wore with prideful ostentation.

Everything went.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There was Colonel Tom Gaitskill, an ideal host, courtly, genial, whose fountains of humor never went dry, making him eternally young.

  "page-462": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">table was John Flournoy, the sheriff whose reputation exceeded the boundaries of the State, a man with a giant’s form and strength, a woman’s tenderness, and the courage of a host of jungle beasts.</p><p>And the guest of honor for the evening was Gaitskill’s life-long friend, Captain Lemuel Manse, a retired millionaire, who had received his title from the fact that he was owner of that beautiful sea-going yacht, whose keel had cut the waters of every sea upon the globe, and which had brought to Tickfall the never-to-be-forgotten Diada.</p><p>For four hours Vinegar Atts had served them in that dining-room, silent, watchful, with some mysterious instinct foreseeing the minutest need of every guest and meeting it before the guest himself was conscious what his need was.</p><p>The talk had become reminiscent.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Say, Lem,” Colonel Gaitskill remarked, “do you</p>",
  "page-463": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">remember how we used to scare the everlasting gizzards out of the niggers on the plantation by holding spiritualistic séances in their cabins?”</p><p>“Will I ever forget it?” Captain Manse laughed. “The darkies used to run when they saw me coming!”</p><p>“I wonder if you have forgotten how to make the table dance?” Gaitskill asked.</p><p>Captain Manse promptly pushed back his chair.</p><p>Vinegar Atts had no idea what was going to happen, but he knew instinctively that the table should be cleared. His long arms reached over the shoulders of the men and the liquors and the cigars were placed upon the sideboard.</p><p>With fun sparkling in his magnetic eyes, Manse arose and began the repetition of a stunt which had amused him half a century before.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Gentlemen,” he began, in a sing-song voice, imitating the manner of the professional mediums,</p>",
  "page-464": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">“there is an even number of us present, which makes a perfect spiritualistic ring.

We are all sincere and open to conviction, and any results which are obtained must surely be authentic.”</p><p>This address concluded amid laughter and applause.</p><p>The four men drew up to the heavy mahogany table and placed their hands upon its polished top, palms down.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“My friends,” Captain Manse said in a husky whisper, “you will all keep silent, please.

No sound was audible except the steady, deep breathing of the four men sitting at the table.</p><p>As for Vinegar Atts, respiration had ceased some minutes before.</p><p>Suddenly, after the long strain of tense silence, Dr. Sentelle, the semi-invalid, took a deep breath—a sigh—and the heavy table rose slowly, teeteringly, under his delicate, fragile, blue-veined hands!</p><p>“Ah, some spirit has come at last,” Captain Manse exclaimed in a deep, sepulchral, sing-song undertone.</p>",
  "page-466": "<p>Again there was total silence, and the strain of waiting, and the sweating palms of the men outspread upon the table; Sheriff Flournoy took a long, deep breath.</p><p>Again the table tipped, bumped against the floor, and settled down!</p><p>“Dr. Sentelle,” Captain Manse spoke in a tone hushed and full of awe, “the spirit of my long-lost dead poll-parrot will answer any question which you desire to ask!”</p><p>Dr. Sentelle sighed audibly.</p><p>He raised his eyes toward the ceiling and in a low, thrilling, beautiful voice, he asked:</p><p>“Are you happy, Polly-parrot, since you became a bird of paradise?”</p><p>Instantly, the heavy table struck the floor three times—bump! bump! bump! “Y-e-s.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There was a whoop of laughter and the men sprang</p>",
  "page-467": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to their feet.</p><p>“By George!” Gaitskill exclaimed with a chuckle. “If some of the experiences Lem and I had when we were young were wiped out of my memory, I wouldn’t know my soul in eternity.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Captain Manse laughed. “I recall one Christmas day when Tom’s niggers were eating in the kitchen, Tom and I went in there and made that table dance all over the place and scared the darkies so they wouldn’t touch a bite of that Christmas dinner. Of course, we had to fake that stunt. In fact, most of this spiritualistic stuff is faked now.”</p><p>“How is it done?” Flournoy asked.</p><p>Captain Manse explained several of the methods by which the table-tipping fakes deceived the credulous public, then the talk drifted into national politics.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In a moment Gaitskill looked up with surprise.

  "page-477": "<p>The negroes sprang to their feet in terror—all except Vinegar Atts. He remained with his hands upon the table, sitting as if in a trance.</p><p>The lamp wick flared, filling the room with smoke.

They looked at him in wonder, not speaking a word.</p><p>After a while Vinegar stood up, opened the door which entered into the church auditorium, and returned with a new lamp chimney. Wiping it out carefully with a soiled bandanna handkerchief, he adjusted it upon the lamp, and said in a cordial voice:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Come in, brudders!

  "page-480": "<p>No one answered the question, but after a pause Pap Curtain inquired:</p><p>“Whut else do he oughter hab?”</p><p>“He oughter hab de gift of power!” Vinegar roared in a mighty voice. “Does you’all believe dat?”</p><p>“Sho’ly!” the men murmured.</p><p>“Now, brudders,” Vinegar went on, “I built dis here church wid my own hands; I begged de money from de white folks to buy de timber whut went in it; I sawed de wood whut made de pulpit an’ de benches, an’ eve’y block of wood in dis church knows my hands an’ obeys my voice.

The men watched Vinegar with ever-increasing horror. Tucky Chew Sipe stood up and flattened himself against the wall, his knees shaking until they threatened any moment to collapse and let him down in a heap upon the floor.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Vinegar moaned. A long, deep sigh whistled through the tense silence, and the table rose two feet from the</p>",
  "page-483": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">floor, teetering uncertainly. Vinegar rose to his feet, and followed the table in its peregrinations around the room, his hands spread wide and resting upon the top.</p><p>“My Gawd!” Tucky Sipe exclaimed.</p><p>Instantly the table went high into the air and shot out toward Tucky Sipe, crashing against the wall, striking Tucky a mighty blow in his lean and hungry  stomach, extinguishing the lamp and hurling it to the floor where it broke into a thousand pieces!</p><p>Instantly Vinegar Atts struck a match and held it up to illumine the darkness.</p><p>He glared a moment at the horrified negroes, then walked over to where the Reverend Tucky Chew Sipe lay flat on the floor in a hysteria of fear, whooping like a siren in a fog.</p><p>“Shut up, brudder, shut up!” Vinegar howled. “You done mourned a plenty.

He sprang up, seized the coat, and wrenched it away.</p><p>“Hol’ on, Vinegar!” he barked. “Whut you doin’ wid all dat harness on yo’ wrists?”</p><p>Vinegar pulled back his big white cuffs and sheepishly displayed the “harness.”</p><p>Around each wrist a large leather strap was securely bound, and from each strap, projecting toward Vinegar’s fingers was a powerful iron hook with a sharp point!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Whut in de name of mud is dat fer?” Skeeter</p>",
  "page-487": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">howled.</p><p>Vinegar grinned, sat down at a little pine table in the middle of the room, spread his open hands upon the table, palms downward, just as he had done at the Shoofly church.</p><p>The two iron hooks fitted securely under the edge of the table, and were effectually concealed by his white cuffs. With the grip and the leverage thus secured, the gorilla arms and iron wrists of Vinegar Atts could have lifted a bale of cotton.</p><p>Vinegar quietly picked up the little table and grinning like a big fat monkey, pranced all around the room before the astounded, admiring eyes of Skeeter Butts.</p><p>Skeeter sat down and chuckled with delight.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Vinegar,” he said, “I always figgered dat a preacher wus a nachel-bawn fool or he wouldn’t be a preacher.

For nearly thirty years neither church had had a change of preachers, so that Dr. Sentelle and Vinegar Atts were old friends and workers in the Tickfall vineyard.</p><p>Dr. Sentelle was a scholar, an orator, and a cripple. All that can be comprised in the statement that the people, white and black, loved him almost to adoration, will express what he was to Tickfall.</p>",
  "page-630": "<p>Vinegar Atts was a squatty, pot-bellied black giant with long gorilla-like arms; he was bald except for a little tuft of hair over each ear, which made him look like a moon-faced mule wearing a blind bridle. He was not a scholar, nor a cripple. He could hang some steel hooks in a five-hundred-pound bale of cotton and trot up the gangplank of a steamboat singing a religious song and not start the perspiration on the top of his bald head by the achievement.</p><p>As for oratory, his colored friends thought that Vinegar was the prince of platform spellbinders. He had the pertinacious guinea-fowl’s gift of gab, a voice which could be heard for two miles, and a <em>vox humana</em> stop to his chest tones that threw in the tremolo for funeral and evangelistic occasions and made his emotional auditors weep copiously over something they did not know anything about.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Vinegar paused at the gate because a stranger was</p>",
  "page-631": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sitting on the porch beside Dr. Sentelle. Vinegar “read sign” on this strange white man to determine whether it would be worth while to go up and interrupt  his conversation by requesting a favor. The stranger was old, white-haired, and his movements and the sound of his voice indicated that he was feeble. Vinegar did not know it, but he was looking at the Rev. Dr. Gilbo, president of the Silliway Female Institute.</p><p>“Dat white man is some sort broke-down preacher,” Vinegar soliloquized, and he rattled the gate-latch loudly.</p><p>“All right, Vinegar, come in!” Dr. Sentelle called. “What do you want?”</p><p>“’Scuse me, white folks,” Vinegar murmured, bowing apologetically to the stranger. “I come to ax Elder Sentelle could he he’p me outen a jam.”</p><p>“Has the Shoofly outfit fired you?” Dr. Sentelle smiled.</p>",
  "page-632": "<p>“Naw, suh. Dey’s gwine bestow special honors on me to-night,” Vinegar chuckled, smoothing his stovepipe hat with a big handkerchief. “I done spent de day fixin’ up de chu’ch wid flowers, an’ now I needs two mo’ things to gimme style. Is you white folks got a pulpit chair an’ a ’lectric readin’ lamp dat you ain’t needin’?”</p><p>Dr. Sentelle appeared to give himself up to deep thought. In reality he was devoting himself to an internal enjoyment of that amusing request. Dr. Gilbo uttered a surprised chuckle which he promptly covered by a cough and hastily offered Vinegar a cigar.</p><p>“What sort of honor is going to be bestowed on you, Vinegar?” Dr. Sentelle asked.</p><p>“De Nights of Darkness Lodge is bought me a D,” Vinegar told him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The white men remained silent, praying for more light. Vinegar busied himself with his cigar, placing the</p>",
  "page-633": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">gold band on his little finger and lighting the smoke.</p><p>“That’s quite an honor,” Dr. Sentelle ventured, wondering what he was talking about and hoping that Vinegar would say something to illumine the darkness.</p><p>“Yes, suh. Dey comes pretty tol’able expensive an’ de lodge couldn’t affode to buy but one,” Vinegar replied, and a little note of disappointment was in his voice.</p><p>“That’s too bad,” Dr. Sentelle murmured sympathetically.</p><p>“De cost wus twenty-five dollars per each D,” Vinegar sighed. “Of co’se dat’s most too high fer niggers to pay, even jes’ one. So I’s mighty glad to git it.”</p><p>“Are you alluding to some lodge degree, my man?” Dr. Gilbo asked.</p><p>“Naw, suh, it’s a preacher degree. All de fust-class preachers has ’em. Of co’se, I would druther hab a D.D., but two of ’em costes fifty dollars.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">With a gasp of astonishment the two men</p>",
  "page-634": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">comprehended what Vinegar was talking about.</p><p>“Oh, I understand,” Dr. Gilbo murmured. “You are receiving the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity to-night.”</p><p>“Yes, suh, dat’s it. Only but I don’t git but one D.”</p><p>“May I inquire what college is honoring you?” Gilbo asked.</p><p>Vinegar’s answer came very near being the end of Dr. Gilbo.</p><p>“De Silliway Female Institoot,” Vinegar told him.</p><p>Then there was silence for the space of ten minutes. Vinegar stood as quietly as a mule hitched to a post. Dr. Sentelle’s frail body was shaking with suppressed laughter. Dr. Gilbo felt that his reason was tottering on the crystal throne of intellect. At last Vinegar spoke:</p><p>“Could you lend me de loant of de pulpit chair an’ de readin’ lamp, elder?”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“No,” Dr. Sentelle murmured chokingly, “I deeply</p>",
  "page-635": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">regret that I cannot.”</p><p>“Thank ’e, suh,” Vinegar responded. “I knows you would ef you could. I reckin I better mosey on. I’s shore much obleeged to dis here nice white man fer my seegar. Thank e, Kunnel.”</p><p>Vinegar turned and walked as far as the gate, when Sentelle called to him.</p><p>“Vinegar, my friend and I would like to attend the meeting at the Shoofly church to-night.”</p><p>Vinegar’s stovepipe hat swept the ground and his grotesque body was distorted into an elaborate bow.</p><p>“My Lawd, white folks,” he howled in delight. “Dis pore ole nigger won’t ax de good Lawd fer no better blessin’ dan to hab you-alls come out to de Shoofly. I’ll hab a place on de flatforms fer bofe you-alls. De orgies begins at nine o’clock.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“That rascal, Green Trapps, is at the bottom of this,” Dr. Gilbo said with conviction. “I am going  out to the</p>",
  "page-636": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Shoofly church to-night, but I don’t intend to arrive at the beginning of the exercises. I think I shall appear at the psychological moment.”</p><p>“I’s wid you in dat plan, white folks,” Dr. Sentelle snickered.</p><p>It was never any trouble to get a crowd in the Shoofly church. All that was necessary was to ring the bell and the colored population flocked to the church like doves to the windows.</p><p>But on this occasion all the brothers of the lodge had hinted that there would be a most important meeting on this particular night, the grapevine telephone had carried the news, and the people began to arrive from the swamps and plantations long before dark. Some of the old women anxious to get a good seat, went trailing up to the church just about sunset like a lot of old hens going to roost.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">By nine o’clock there was not standing room in the</p>",
  "page-637": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">church, nor a fence-post or a tree around the building to which another horse or mule could be hitched.</p><p>After the congregation had sung songs until they were almost exhausted, Hitch Diamond stepped up to the platform and spoke:</p><p>“Brudders an’ sisteren, we is come to dis place so dat de lodge brudders of de Nights of Darkness kin bestow a D on Revun Vinegar Atts. Eve’ybody chipped in a few change an’ we bought it fer him wid twenty-five dollars. De high chief money-keeper will now advance an’ hand over de money.”</p><p>Figger Bush pushed through the crowd, and emptied  all his pockets, as he laid a pile of silver on a little table beside the pulpit.</p><p>“I ain’t spent none of it, brudders,” he announced. “It’s all right dar jes’ like you gib it to me.”</p><p>“Perfessor Green Trapps will now advance wid de obscribe!” Hitch commanded.</p>",
  "page-638": "<p>Thereupon, Green rose from a chair near the pulpit and walked to the little table. He took from his pocket a square of sheepskin, spread it out before him, and flattened it out by piling a handful of silver around the edges. Then he fitted his gold spectacles to his pop eyes, unscrewed the top of a fountain pen and sat down.</p><p>There was a slight commotion at the door, but Green did not notice it. There was a scrouging of people who stood in the aisle in order that two distinguished white men might pass, but Green Trapps did not notice that. Green looked up just as the two white men stood at the pulpit railing almost within reach of his hand. Then his startled eyes gazed down into the faces of Dr. Gilbo, president of the Silliway Female Institute, and Dr. Sentelle.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Gawdlemighty!” Green gasped. He sprang from his chair and sent that piece of furniture whirling across the platform. With four gigantic leaps he covered the space</p>",
  "page-639": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">between himself and the nearest window, and he went through that window, splashing the crowd out of his way in his exit like a brickbat dropped in a puddle of black mud.</p><p>The people were dazed by this sudden departure of Trapps, and they waited breathlessly for what might happen next. Dr. Gilbo strode upon the pulpit  platform and stopped at the table where Green had been sitting. With a snort of indignation, he realized that his servant, Green Trapps, had stolen one of his college graduate diplomas, and was just about to fill it out with the name of Vinegar Atts.</p><p>Dr. Gilbo turned and addressed the audience:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“My colored friends, I regret to inform you that Green Trapps is a fraud and impostor, also a liar and a thief. He persuaded you to raise a sum of money to purchase from him an honorary degree from the Silliway Female Institute which he had no right or</p>",
  "page-640": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">power to bestow. This college, of which I am president, does not grant honorary degrees, and if it did, we would not sell such an honor under any circumstances or at any price. I think you should congratulate yourselves upon my arrival just in time to thwart the nefarious designs of Green Trapps. He was endeavoring to secure money under false pretenses, and if I remain in my present state of righteous indignation, I shall have him prosecuted under the law.”</p><p>Then Dr. Gilbo stalked off the platform and sat down.</p><p>“Beg parding, boss,” Hitch Diamond mumbled. “Does I gather from dem remarks of yourn dat Brudder Vinegar Atts don’t git no D?”</p><p>“He does not from the Silliway Female Institute,” Dr. Gilbo answered.</p><p>“Dat’s too bad,” Hitch Diamond rumbled, scratching his head and wondering what to do next.</p>",
  "page-641": "<p>At this point, Skeeter Butts, who was sitting in the choir, rose and said:</p><p>“Brudder Hitchie, I moves dat de twenty-five dollars dat Green Trapps didn’t git be give to Elder Vinegar Atts to buy a pulpit chair an’ a ’lectric readin’ lamp.”</p><p>“I seconts dat motion,” Pap Curtain snarled. “Dat’ll let Vinegar down kinder easy an’ won’t hurt his feelin’s so much.”</p><p>When Hitch Diamond put the question, the motion was carried with a whoop and everybody was in a good humor again.</p><p>“Less sing our lodge song fer de closin’ exercises, brudders,” Hitch bellowed. “Eve’ybody sing!”</p><p>“Ef a smile we kin renew<br>As our journey we pursue,<br>Oh, de good we all may do<br>While de days is gwine by.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In this mighty chorus, Dr. Sentelle missed a voice</p>",
  "page-642": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that he loved—the superb baritone of Vinegar Atts. That voice, like the tones of a great pipe-organ, was the joy and pride of Tickfall. Now it was silent.</p><p>Dr. Sentelle turned and looked at Vinegar. The pastor of the Shoofly church sat huddled in a heap in his broken-bottomed pulpit chair, looking like a big, fat dumpling soaked in gravy. His simple, childish, baby face was puckered and drawn with sad lines until he looked like a big fat baby just tuning up to cry.</p><p>In fact, Vinegar was completely crushed. He had set his heart upon that meaningless piece of parchment and that sham degree, and the loss to him was  overwhelming. The pathos of ignorance lies here, that the untaught covet above everything the tinsel and feathers and adornments of knowledge.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Oh, de worl’ is full of sighs,<br>Full of sad an’ weepin’ eyes;<br>He’p yo’ fallen brudder</p>",
  "page-643": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">rise<br>While de days is gwine by.”</p><p>Still Vinegar’s superb voice was silent, and Dr. Sentelle felt a sense of loss and dissatisfaction. The music was not complete.</p><p>Then something happened which explains why all Tickfall, white and black, loved Dr. Sentelle almost to adoration.</p><p>Suddenly an idea burst like an opening blossom in the scholar’s brain, and brought forth its fruit of kindly and gracious service. He rose to his feet, leaning his frail body heavily upon his ponderous cane for support, and held up a thin, blue-veined, delicate hand for silence. The singing stopped.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“My friends,” he began in a voice so thrillingly sweet and musical that every word was like a caress, “for over thirty years your pastor, Vinegar Atts, and I have been the only preachers in Tickfall. He and I have spent</p>",
  "page-644": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">many an hour in that time discussing together the problems which concern both the white and the black people of Tickfall. While the days have been going by, Vinegar has added much to my joy of living, and I am sure that he has never robbed you of any happiness.”</p><p>“Dat’s right!” a dozen voices murmured.</p><p>“I have always tried to stand between you colored  people and any kind of harm, and it pleases me tonight that I have been instrumental in preventing you from paying something for nothing—absolutely nothing!”</p><p>“Thank ’e, suh!” several voices spoke.</p><p>“Nevertheless, I believe that Vinegar Atts very richly deserves the one D which you in your kindness were trying to purchase for him.”</p><p>“Hear dat, now!”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“The word ‘doctor’ is an academic title, originally meaning a man so well versed in his department as to be qualified to teach it. I knew Vinegar Atts years ago as a</p>",
  "page-645": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">prize-fighter, and I have seen him fight; and I assure you that in the department of pugilistic activity, Vinegar is well enough versed in the manly art of self-defense to know how to teach it!”</p><p>“Now you done said a plum’ mouthful!” Hitch Diamond, the Tickfall Tiger, howled. “Elder Atts teached me all <em>I</em> know ’bout fightin’!”</p><p>“Thirty years have passed since Vinegar became the pastor of the Shoofly church. In that time, negro preachers have come and gone through the other negro churches in this parish like a Mardi Gras procession, but Vinegar holds on to his job. It is my conviction that a man so endowed with the gift of continuance possesses the supreme art of pleasing all the people all the time, and should be qualified to teach that art to others.”</p><p>“Listen to dat white man!” a chorus of voices mumbled in admiration.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“I therefore believe that Vinegar Atts richly deserves</p>",
  "page-646": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the title of doctor, and I therefore greet him  as a fellow clergyman with his honorary entitlements: ‘Dr. Vinegar Atts.’”</p><p>Vinegar was not slumped down in his chair now. He was sitting up in his broken-bottomed chair, his backbone as stiff as if he had swallowed a ramrod. Dr. Sentelle walked over and held out his hand. Vinegar sprang up with a half sob and seized that fragile white hand in his gorilla-like black paw.</p><p>There was a shout from that congregation which nearly lifted the roof off the church.</p><p>Then Dr. Gilbo was suddenly galvanized into action. He sprang up from his seat and knocked his hat on the floor. He jerked his hands in and out of his pockets, seeking for something, and in his eagerness he spilled something out of each pocket.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Suddenly he found what he wanted and held it up—a little square box, such as jewelers use. Taking the top</p>",
  "page-647": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">from the box, he brought out a small gold medal about the size of a postage stamp, and almost as thin.</p><p>“My colored friends,” Dr. Gilbo announced in a shrill, high voice. “This gold medal which you behold is bestowed upon the deserving pupils of the Silliway Female Institute as a reward of merit. At our graduating exercises last June twenty-five of these medals were given away, but it happened that no pupil earned the one which I hold in my hand. It is now my pleasure to confer this medal on Dr. Vinegar Atts!”</p><p>When Dr. Gilbo walked across the platform and pinned his medal upon the lapel of Vinegar’s long-tailed preaching-coat, there is no language to describe  the whoop of adulation which sprang from the throats of that delighted audience.</p><p>Vinegar Atts sat down and wiped the tears from his eyes upon his coat sleeve.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“Us would like to hear a speech from de Revun Dr.</p>",
  "page-648": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Vinegar Atts!” Hitch Diamond bellowed.</p><p>The prince of platform spellbinders stood up and made a speech of two words, but in the intonation of those two words he comprised all that a negro can express of eloquent gratitude:</p><p>“Bless Gawd!”</p><p>He sat down for the last time in his broken pulpit chair, and his powerful shoulders quivered with emotion. The next day he put a new chair in its place, adorned his pulpit with an electric reading lamp, and recovered his gift of gab.</p><p>“Lodge brudders, attention!” Hitch Diamond bellowed. “Give de good-night salute an’ sing de last verse!”</p><p>The men folded their hands over their breasts and their superb voices chanted:</p><pre class=\"  \">“But de deeds of good we sow  \nBofe in shade an’ shine will grow,  \n</pre>",
  "page-649": "<pre class=\"no-indent  \">An’ will keep our hearts aglow,  \nWhile de days is gwine by.”</pre><p>Dr. Sentelle listened and smiled. The music was complete.</p><p>He reflected that he had never heard Dr. Vinegar Atts sing so well.</p><hr class=\"section\">"
